    <h1>White Screen</h1>
    <p>
      A white screen can act as a lifesaver when checking all the dirt and dust
      particles and dead, stuck, white, and warm pixels. It is almost impossible
      for anyone to stop dust from settling on a screen, but it is quite
      possible to clean all of it with a white screen. A white screen is helpful
      to notice the dirt & dust on the monitor, which further leads to an easy
      cleaning experience.
